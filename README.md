## INTRODUCTION 

* AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.
* The AWS service is provided by the Amazon that uses distributed IT infrastructure to provide different IT resources available on demand. It provides different services such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS).
* Amazon launched AWS, a cloud computing platform to allow the different organizations to take advantage of reliable IT infrastructure.

### **What is Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing resources, including servers, storage, applications, and services over the internet. It enables users to access a pool of shared computing resources, rather than owning and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Cloud computing can be categorized into three main types of services: 

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): provides virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, on a pay-per-use basis. 

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): offers a complete development and deployment environment for applications, including tools, libraries, and frameworks. 

3. Software as a Service (SaaS): delivers applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need to install and maintain software locally.

Cloud computing offers several benefits, including scalability, flexibility, cost savings, and ease of use. It allows organizations to quickly provision and deprovision resources, scale up or down based on demand, and pay only for what they use.

### **Introduction to AWS**

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that offers a wide range of services and tools for building and deploying scalable and reliable applications. AWS provides a vast collection of cloud-based services that include computing, storage, databases, analytics, machine learning, and much more.

AWS provides a pay-as-you-go model, where customers are charged based on their usage of each service. The platform is designed to provide scalable, reliable, and secure infrastructure, enabling businesses to quickly and easily deploy their applications and services on a global scale.

AWS offers several benefits, including:

**Scalability**: AWS can automatically scale resources up or down based on application demand, enabling businesses to easily accommodate sudden spikes in traffic or usage.

**Reliability**: AWS provides multiple availability zones and redundancy options, ensuring high availability and uptime for applications and services.

**Security**: AWS offers a comprehensive set of security tools and features, including encryption, identity and access management, and network security, ensuring the safety of data and applications.

**Flexibility**: AWS offers a vast array of services and tools, allowing businesses to choose the ones that best meet their needs and easily integrate with their existing systems.

Overall, AWS is a powerful cloud computing platform that provides businesses with the tools and services they need to build, deploy, and manage their applications and services on a global scale.

### AWS Global Infrastructure

* AWS is a cloud computing platform which is globally available.
* Global infrastructure is a region around the world in which AWS is based. Global infrastructure is a bunch of high-level IT services which is shown below:
* AWS is available in 19 regions, and 57 availability zones in December 2018 and 5 more regions 15 more availability zones for 2019.

The following are the components that make up the AWS infrastructure:

* [**Availability Zones**](#availability-zone-as-a-data-center)
* [**Region**](#region)
* [**Edge locations**](#edge-locations)
* [**Regional Edge Caches**](#regional-edge-cache)

#### Availability zone as a Data Center

* An availability zone is a facility that can be somewhere in a country or in a city. Inside this facility, i.e., Data Centre, we can have multiple servers, switches, load balancing, firewalls. The things which interact with the cloud sits inside the data centers.
* An availability zone can be a several data centers, but if they are close together, they are counted as 1 availability zone.

#### Region

* A region is a geographical area. Each region consists of 2 more availability zones.
* A region is a collection of data centers which are completely isolated from other regions.
* A region consists of more than two availability zones connected to each other through links.

* Availability zones are connected through redundant and isolated metro fibers.

#### Edge Locations

* Edge locations are the endpoints for AWS used for caching content.
* Edge locations consist of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).
* Edge locations are more than regions. Currently, there are over 150 edge locations.
* Edge location is not a region but a small location that AWS have. It is used for caching the content.
* Edge locations are mainly located in most of the major cities to distribute the content to end users with reduced latency.
* For example, some user accesses your website from Singapore; then this request would be redirected to the edge location closest to Singapore where cached data can be read.

#### Regional Edge Cache

* AWS announced a new type of edge location in November 2016, known as a Regional Edge Cache.
* Regional Edge cache lies between CloudFront Origin servers and the edge locations.
* A regional edge cache has a large cache than an individual edge location.
* Data is removed from the cache at the edge location while the data is retained at the Regional Edge Caches.
* When the user requests the data, then data is no longer available at the edge location. Therefore, the edge location retrieves the cached data from the Regional edge cache instead of the Origin servers that have high latency.
